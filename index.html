    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The name Ichthyosaur is originally from Greek, ιχθυς or ichthys meaning "fish" and σαυρος or sauros meaning "lizard". This “fish lizard” is a species of extinct prehistoric marine reptile (Torrens, 1995). </p>
    <p>Mary Anning has been credited with the first discovery of Ichthyosaur fossils (Torrens, 1995). Sometime between 1809 and 1811, Mary found Ichthyosaur fossils with her brother at the age of 12 years old near the English coastal town of Lyme Regis (Torrens, 1995). Although she found the majority of the remains, her brother discovered parts of the fossil twelve months earlier (Torrens, 1995). In fact, the entire Anning family was involved in fossil hunting as a form of income.  The fossils were heavily sought after not only by museums and scientists but also by private collectors (Torrens, 1995). </p>

      <p><i>"This sea-going reptile with terrestrial ancestors converged so strongly on fishes that it actually evolved a dorsal fin and tail in just the right place and with just the right hydrological design. These structures are all the more remarkable because they evolved from nothing – the ancestral terrestrial reptile had no hump on its back or blade on its tail to serve as a precursor" (Gould, 1993).</i></p>
      <p>Biologist Stephen Jay Gould said that the Ichthyosaur was his favourite example of convergent evolution.  He said that common descent is not the reason for its similarities to fish, but analogous, which is caused by natural selection in the same environment (Gould, 1993).</p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>When & Where:</strong> Ichthyosaurs, a Mesozoic era  fish-like bodied tetrapod marine reptile first appeared in the Triassic period around 240 million years ago (Massare, 1990). Its diversity peaked in the Jurassic period (Williston, 1917).  Ichthyosaurs lived in oceans and had a worldwide distribution, based on its fossils found globally.   The species experienced a species decline near the early late (middle) Cretaceous period, eventually leading to its extinction (Maisch, 2011).</p>

    <p><strong>Evolution History:</strong> The Ichthyosaur evolved from land or shore reptiles called Cartorhynchus that returned to the sea (Maisch, 2011). Like all creatures, these land dwelling ancestors also originated from the sea.  What prompted these ancestors to evolve to walk on land and then return into the ocean was due to the rich source of marine food and to avoid land predators (Lomax, 2018).  </p>

    <p><strong>Morphology:</strong> In general, Ichthyosaurs resembled the physical appearance of modern day dolphins.  Their size varies but the average length of Ichthyosauria were from 2 to 4 metres but some species can reach about 15 metres long(Massare, 1990).  Ichthyosaurs consisted of many species, having similar habits and traits such as heavy jaws, sharp teeth and fish-like bodies (Williston, 1917).  Overall, their heads were pointed, their neck was short and their limbs were adapted into flippers. Ichthyosaurs had the largest eyes ever recorded for any animal and were used to see in dark marine environments (National Geographic, 2018). Some scientists inferred that they had a layer of blubber for insulation (Sander, 2000). Some species weighted around 200 kilograms while bigger species weighted nearly 900 kilograms (Massare, 1990).

</p>
    <p><strong>Diet:</strong> Ichthyosaurs varied greatly in size and existed for nearly the entire Mesozoic Era (Massare, 1990). Due to its long period of existence, Ichthyosaurs had countless prey to choose from. It is noteworthy that not all Ichthyosaurs hunted the same prey.  Most of Ichthyosaurs fed on fish and ancient cephalopods (Sander, 2000). Larger Ichthyosaurs also fed on small aquatic reptiles due to blade-like teeth in their powerful jaws, which were capable of killing the bigger prey (Sander, 2000).</p>

    <p><strong>Extinction:</strong> The dolphin-like Ichthyosaurs died out 66 million years ago, 30 million years before the mass extinction that wiped out all the non-bird dinosaurs (Lomax, 2018).  Vertebrate palaeontologist Dr. Valentin Fischer indicated that the extinction of Ichthyosaurs, which were extremely well adapted to oceanic life was a long-standing enigma (Lomax, 2018). Lots of hypotheses have been proposed to explain this ancient marine reptiles disappearance.  One universally accepted opinion is that increased competition from other marine reptiles and fish and the decline of their main food source, squid-like belemnites was what caused the extinction of Ichthyosaurs (Williston, 1917).</p>  <p>Once known as the king of the sea, Ichthyosaurs could not compete with other apex aquatic predators such as the Plesiosaurs, Pliosaurs, Mosasaurs, and advanced sharks (Lomax, 2018).  These  predators took over many of the Ichthyosaur’s niches and put pressure in food competition, which ultimately could have contributed to the reptile extinction in the mid Cretaceous period (Lomax, 2018).  Another hypothesis was that Ichthyosaurs were also not able to catch the fast fish that evolved in the Cretaceous Period (Lomax, 2018).  </p>

    <p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> <ul>
  <p><li>Ichthyosaurs looked very similar to dolphins but they were completely unrelated! Ichthyosaurs were one of the marine reptiles that were adapted to be ocean dwellers around 200 million years before dolphins. Dolphins had a different origin as they evolved from legged marine mammals (Pichler, 2001). Although they look similar, the reason is suspected to be from natural selection as a streamlined body is a huge advantage when it comes to swimming (Pichler, 2001).</li>
  <p><li>Although Ichthyosaurs were marine reptiles, they gave birth to live young in the sea instead of laying eggs, which is documented by the fossil records since the end of the Anisian stage (Sander, 2000). Due to streamlined flattened bodies, Ichthyosaurs cannot move to land to lay eggs, like sea turtles and alligators. </li></p>

</li>
  <li>This fact might surprise you: Ichthyosaurs were probably warm blooded even though they are classified as marine reptiles (Lindgren, 2018). The discovery of blubber in an Ichthyosaur fossil indicated that they were likely warm-blooded (Lindgren, 2018). It is based off the fact that all modern sea animals with blubber maintain a constant body temperature, like whales and seals (Lindgren, 2018). </li>
